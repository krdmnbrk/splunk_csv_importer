# CSV to Splunk Lookup Importer

To make it easier to upload CSV files as lookups in Splunk remotely, I developed a solution using SPL (Splunk Processing Language). This approach worked well for me, and Iâ€™m sharing it in hopes that it will help others in the community too.

## Features

- **CSV to Lookup**: Upload `.csv` files as Splunk lookups.
- **Backup Existing Lookups**: Automatically backup lookups with a timestamp if they already exist.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/krdmnbrk/splunk_csv_importer.git
    cd splunk_csv_importer
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set up `.env`**:
    ```ini
    SPLUNK_HOST=your-splunk-host
    SPLUNK_PORT=8089
    SPLUNK_TOKEN=your-splunk-token
    ```

## Usage

```bash
python splunk_csv_importer.py --source_file path/to/your.csv --target_lookup_name your_lookup_name.csv
```

Example:
```bash
python splunk_csv_importer.py --source_file data.csv --target_lookup_name my_lookup.csv
```

If a lookup exists, it will be backed up with a timestamp.

## Example Workflow

1. Set up `.env` with your Splunk details.
2. Run the script with your CSV file.
3. Check your lookup in Splunk using:
    ```spl
    | inputlookup your_lookup_name.csv
    ```
